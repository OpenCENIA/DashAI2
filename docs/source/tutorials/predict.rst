Make Predictions
=================

This tutorial will guide you through the process of making predictions using trained models in DashAI.

Prerequisites
-------------
Before starting, make sure you have:

* A trained model in DashAI
* A dataset for predictions with the same format as training data

Step-by-Step Guide
------------------

1. Create new prediction

* Review the prediction results
* Download the predictions if needed

Tips and Best Practices
------------------------

* Ensure your prediction dataset has the same format as training data
* Verify that all required input columns are present
* Use the same preprocessing steps as during training

Troubleshooting
---------------

* Common issues:
    - Missing columns
    - Different column names
    - Incompatible data types
    - File format errors
